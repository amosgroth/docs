# How to Recover Your Umbrel Jam Wallet

This guide will show you how to recover your [Jam wallet](https://github.com/joinmarket-webui/jam) that you somehow have lost on your [Umbrel](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel) server. You will be guided through different recovery scenarios, depending on what has happened (e. g. hard drive failure) - or more precisely - what you have at hand (e. g. seed phrase).

<p align="center"><strong>⚠️ Jam and Umbrel is beta software, it can fail at any time. Your hardware can fail at any time.<br/>Write down your seed phrase right after installation so you don't have to worry about losing funds! ⚠️</strong></p>

## Prerequisites
It is crucial to know that Umbrel and Jam don't share the same wallet. What you do with and have in your Umbrel wallet is completely apart from your Jam wallet. Jam is using your Umbrel Bitcoin Core
